## About me    

  I am a process engineer. One day I realized that I did not want to devote my life to the existing profession and I needed to change something, and began to study web programming. I started studying in the summer of 2020. For half a year of independent study, I was able to learn at a basic level: **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS** (below average). Very diligent and trodophilous, if I took up something I will bring the matter to the end.


## Experience    
* HTML  
* CSS  
* JavaScript(basic)  
* GIT

## Example code    
```
function solve(stones) {
  let rgb = stones.split('')
  let res = 0;
  for (i=0; i<rgb.length; i++) {
    if (rgb[i] == rgb[i+1]){
      res += 1;
    }
    else {
    res += 0;
    }
  }
  return res;
}
```
